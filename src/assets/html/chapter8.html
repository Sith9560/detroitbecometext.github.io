        At Carl's house
    </h1>
    <p>
        <span class="name">Alarm</span>: Good evening, Carl. Welcome back.
        <br><span class="name">Carl</span>: That was by far the most boring party I've been to in the last 25 years. Every time I go to one of these, I ask myself: what the hell am I doing here? I hate cocktail parties and all the schmoozers that go there. 
        <br><span class="name">Markus</span>: Well, it's a chance for all those people who admire your work to meet you. 
        <br><span class="name">Carl</span>: No one gives a damn about art. All they care about is how much money they're gonna make out of it. Come on, let's have a drink! All the excitement of this whole thing has made me thirsty.
        <br><span class="name">Markus</span>: Scotch, neat, as usual? 
        <br><span class="name">Carl</span>: Absolutely.
        <br><span class="name">Markus</span>: Okay! But you know what your doctor would say... 
        <br><span class="name">Carl</span>: Yeah... Well, he can kiss my ass! I'm old enough to choose my own medication... Did you leave the light on in the studio? 
        <br><span class="name">Markus</span>: No... No, I'm sure I didn't.
        <br><span class="name">Carl</span>: Call the Police.
        <br><span class="name">Police</span>: Detroit Police, what's your emergency? 
        <br><span class="name">Markus</span>: This is Carl Manfred's android, at 8941 Lafayette Avenue. We've just returned home and found the lights on. There may have been a break-in... 
        <br><span class="name">Police</span>: A patrol car is on the way. 
        <br><span class="name">Carl</span>: Let's go check it out.

        <br><span class="name">Leo</span>: Look, they're all going to be mine sooner or later anyway... Just think of it as a down payment on my inheritance...
