They're so fucking perfect, they ruined my fucking life... What are you looking at?... What's your fuckin' problem? Not the life you dreamed of, eh? Maybe you think this is easy? Maybe you think it's my fault we live in this fuckin' shithole, my fault your fuckin' mother took off? "You should stop takin' drugs, Todd". "Sometimes you really scare me, Todd". Fuckin' bitch took off without a word. Fuckin' whore walked out on me for a fuckin' accountant! It's all your fault!
