    <span class="name">Android employee 1</span>: This is the top of the range
    household assistant. It cooks 10,000 different dishes, speaks 200 languages
    and dialects and handles the kids' homework from elementary school up to
    university level.<br />
    <span class="name">Woman</span> : Wow, honey, it looks amazing... This is
    exactly what we need...<br />
    <span class="name">Man</span> : How much did you say it costs?<br />
    <span class="name">Android employee 1</span>: At the moment we're doing a
    special promotion on this entire range at $7999, with a 48-months interest
    free credit. And it comes with a two-year warranty for parts and labor.<br />
    <span class="name">Man</span> : We'll take it.<br />
    <span class="name">Android employee 1</span>: An excellent choice, sir. If
    you'll just follow me, we'll process the order.

    <span class="name">Man</span> : We're still gonna have to finance it, I
    can't pay for that cash.<br />
    <span class="name">Android employee 2</span>: Good afternoon! Can I help
    you?<br />
    <span class="name">Man</span> : Please, we're looking for a little help
    around the house.<br />
    <span class="name">Android employee 2</span>: The MP500 is a very basic
    model, it pretty much handles all the chores around the house. I can show
    you another model.<br />
    <span class="name">Man</span> : Okay.<br />
    <span class="name">Android employee 2</span>: It does absolutely all the
    work around the house: painting, plumbing, gardening, repairs. At night, it
    switches to surveillance mode and contacts emergency services if there's a
    break-in, or if it detects smoke.<br />
    <span class="name">Man</span> : Excuse me, how much is that one over
    there?<br />
    <span class="name">Android employee 2</span>: The MP800 is slightly more
    expensive, but it has many other functions. Come along and I'll show you.<br />
    <span class="name">Man</span> : Slightly more expensive and lots of
    functions... I don't like this guy. I'm not spending a penny over four.
    That's it. Okay? Forget about it.

    <span class="name">Human employee</span>: Thank you, and we're good.<br />
    <span class="name">Todd</span>: Can I go pick it up?<br />
    <span class="name">Human employee</span>: Yeah, right back here. There it
    is. It was a bit difficult getting it back in working order. It was really
    messed up... What did you say happened to it again?<br />
    <span class="name">Todd</span>: Huh, A car hit it... Stupid accident...<br />
    <span class="name">Human employee</span>: Oh, I see... Anyway, it's as good
    as new now... Except that we had to reset it. Meaning we had to wipe its
    memory. Hope you don't mind.<br />
    <span class="name">Todd</span>: That'll be fine.<br />
    <span class="name">Human employee</span>: Okay, did you give it a name?<br />
    <span class="name">Todd</span>: My daughter did...<br />
    <span class="name">Human employee</span>: AX400, register your name.<br />
    <span class="name">Todd</span>: Kara.<br />
    <span class="name">Kara</span>: My name is Kara.
