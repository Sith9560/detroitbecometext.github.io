        <span class="name">Hank</span>: Oh, very funny. Just tell me what happened.<br>
        <span class="name">Ben</span>: We had a call around eight from the landlord. The tenant hadn't paid his rent for
        a few months, so he thought he'd drop by, see what was going on... That's when he found the body... Jesus, that smell!
        Was even worse before we opened the windows... The victim's name's Carlos Ortiz. He has a record for theft and aggravated
        assault... According to the neighbors, he was kind of a loner... Stayed inside most of the time, they hardly ever
        saw him.<br>
        <span class="name">Hank</span>: Uh, state he's in... Wasn't worth calling everybody out in the middle of the night...
        Could've waited 'til morning.<br>
        <span class="name">Ben</span>: I'd say he's been there for a good three weeks. We'll know more when the coroner gets
        here. There's a kitchen knife over here... Probably the murder weapon...
        <br><span class="name">Hank</span>: Any sign of a break-in?
        <br><span class="name">Ben</span>: Nope... The landlord said the front door was locked from the inside, all the windows
        were boarded up. The killer must've gone out the back way.
        <br><span class="name">Hank</span>: What do we know about his android ?
        <br><span class="name">Ben</span>: Not much. The neighbors confirmed he had one, but it wasn't here when we arrived...
