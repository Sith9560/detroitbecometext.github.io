        <strong>Listening to the radio</strong>
        <br><span class="name">KNC - Rosanna Cartland</span>: With all androids being turned over to the authorities, the country is grinding to a halt. Hospitals and schools are closing. Water cuts, blackouts, and network failures are expected. Maybe most worrying of all, our armed forces have lost two thirds of their effective personnel-
        <br><span class="name">Rose</span>: How about some music instead?

        <strong>Arriving at Jericho</strong>
        <br><span class="name">Rose</span>: A little further on that way, there's a large freighter called Jericho. When you get there, find Markus. He will help you. The last bus for the border leaves at
        midnight. You absolutely have to be on it. You'll be safer on the other side. It's not much, but it's a start. My brother lives in Ontario, I've given you his address... He'll be able to hide you until things calm down. You're a very brave little girl, Alice. You deserve to be happy. 
        <br><span class="name">Kara</span>: Thank you for everything, Rose. 
        <br><span class="name">Rose</span>: Let me know when you make it over there, all right? And be careful.
