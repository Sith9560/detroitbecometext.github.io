        >: Good morning. <br /><span class="name">Markus</span>: It's 10AM. The
        weather's partly cloudy, 54Â°, 80% humidity, with a strong possibility of
        afternoon showers. <br /><span class="name">Carl</span>: It sounds like
        a good day to spend in bed... <br /><span class="name">Markus</span>: I
        did go to pickup the paint that you ordered. <br /><span class="name"
            >Carl</span
        >: Oh yes, I'd forgotten! That is the difference between you and me,
        right Markus? You never forget anything... <br /><span class="name"
            >Markus</span
        >: Show me your arm please, Carl. <br /><span class="name">Carl</span>:
        No! <br /><span class="name">Markus</span>: Carl... Thank you.
        <br /><span class="name">Carl</span>: I just opened my eyes and I'm
        already gritting my teeth... Humans are such a fragile machine... They
        break down so quickly... All this effort to keep 'em going...

                nothing... Just some demonstrators in the street, Carl...
                <br /><span class="name">Carl</span>: What a bunch of idiots...
                They think they can stop progress by roughing up a few androids?

        today? <br /><span class="name">Markus</span>: Yes, there's the opening
        of your retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art. The gallery director
        left four messages asking to confirm your attendance. <br /><span

        <strong><i class="fas fa-tv"></i> Listening to TV</strong>
        <br /><span class="name">Michael Brinkley - CTN TV</span>: Tensions
        continue to rise in the Arctic since Russia unilaterally declared the
        region part of its national territory. Several Russian warships have
        taken position in the Barents Sea since Saturday and a Russian flag now
        flies over the ice field. The Russian president, repeated in a speech to
        the Duma that the Arctic belongs to Russia as a matter of fact. On the
        other hand, last night the American ambassador again informed an
        emergency meeting of the UN that the United States would not accept this
        annexation under any circumstances. Several American destroyers are
        reported to be headed for the Barents Sea. Douglas Cornwell, Chairman of
        the UN, announced at a press conference that we have never been so close
        to a Third World War. He called on Russia and the United States to
        promptly renew talks before things get out of control. <br /><span

        stupidity and violence... 5,000 years of civilization just to get to
        where we are...

        <strong>Copied object</strong>
        <br /><span class="name">Carl</span>: That is a perfect copy, of
        reality. But painting is not about replicating the world, it's about
        interpreting it, improving on it, showing something you see. <br /><span

        >: Carl, I don't...think I can do that. It's not in my program... I...
        <br /><span class="name">Carl</span>: Go on, go, try, grab that canvas.
        Do something for me, close your eyes. Close your eyes. Trust me. Try to
        imagine something that doesn't exist. Something you've never seen. Now,
        concentrate...on how it makes you feel...and let your hand drift across
        the canvas.

        <br /><span class="name">Carl</span>: Oh my God... <br /><span
            class="name"
            >Leo</span
        >: Hey, Dad. <br /><span class="name">Carl</span>: Leo... I didn't hear
        you come in... <br /><span class="name">Leo</span>: Ah, I was in the
        neighborhood... I thought I'd stop by... It's been a while, right?
        <br /><span class="name">Carl</span>: You all right? You don't look so
        good. <br /><span class="name">Leo</span>: Oh, yeah, yeah, I'm fine...
        Hey listen, uh... I need some cash, Dad. <br /><span class="name"
            >Carl</span
        >: Again? What happened to the money I just gave you? <br /><span
            class="name"
            >Leo</span
        >: Uh well, it just goes, you know? <br /><span class="name">Carl</span
        >: Yeah... Yeah, you're on it again, aren't you? <br /><span
            class="name"
            >Leo</span
        >: No, no, no, I swear it's not that... <br /><span class="name"
            >Carl</span
        >: Don't lie to me, Leo. <br /><span class="name">Leo</span>: What
        difference does it make? I just need some cash, that's all! <br /><span
            class="name"
            >Carl</span
        >: Sorry...the answer's no. <br /><span class="name">Leo</span>: What?
        Why? <br /><span class="name">Carl</span>: You know why. <br /><span
            class="name"
            >Leo</span
        >: Yeah, yeah... I think I do know why. You'd rather take care of your
        plastic toy here than your own son, eh? Tell me dad, what's it got that
        I don't? It's smarter? More obedient? Not like me, right? But you know
        what? This thing is not your son. IT'S A FUCKING MACHINE! <br /><span
            class="name"
            >Carl</span
        >: Leo, that's enough! Enough! <br /><span class="name">Leo</span>: You
        don't care about anything except yourself and your goddamn paintings.
        You've never loved anyone. You've never loved me, Dad... You never loved
        me.
