        <strong><fa-icon icon="tv"></fa-icon> Looking at the TV</strong>
        <br /><span class="name">Michael Webb - Channel 16</span>: And now to
        sports. First up, basketball: as the Gears prepare for their critical
        match with Denver tonight at the CyberLife Arena in Detroit, league
        negotiations are still on-going over the possibility of allowing one
        android player per squad. Debate rages as to whether the change would
        lead to more exciting matches, or be the first step in making human
        players obsolete. CyberLife has announced its willingness to participate
        in the experiment by providing one specialized model to every team. Now,
        androids are already used to train players and provide tactical advice
        for coaches since 2035, but no android player has been permitted to
        compete, so far. <br /><span class="name"
            >Michael Brinkley - CTN TV</span
        >: Another 225,000 jobs were lost from the US economy in October,
        according to the Department of Labor, bringing the unemployment figure
        up to 37.3%. <br /><span class="name">Rosanna Cartland - KNC</span>:
        President Warren spoke today at the opening of a new CyberLife plant
        near Milwaukee. At the event, the President again praised CyberLife's
        role in the exceptional performance of the US economy. She further
        announced that the Department of Defense will acquire 200,000 android
        combat units as part of her increased military spending.
